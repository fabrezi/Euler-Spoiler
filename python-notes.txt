According to geohot there are four paradigms of programmig (on a high - level these are the languages that a normal programmar will
encounter):

1. Imperative: Imperative in english means something important. In programming, it is to follow steps to make the required 
changes to the state of the program. it follows each line of code serially. for instance: park a car. step 1, step 2 etc. 
Java and Python are considered imperative.

2. Hardware: these are languages that execute all the commands simulataneously. this is similar to the working of hardware. this includes
Coq and VHDL.

3. functional: these are languages in which the commands are functions itself. the commands are not serial and do not dictate
the state change. it essentailly define the fucntion and let the program work accordingly. eg: Haskell.

4. Machine Learning: this includes Lisp, Tensorflow, Pytorch. fundamentally these lang. are used for deep learning paradigm and
uses graph programming paradigm to do data processing and testing.

Python is a programmaing language that was created by Guido von Rossum in 1990. It is imperative, interpreted, dynamic and
high-level language. If anyone is required to start programming, this be the language to be used. It is a good language for 
communicating with the machine.
