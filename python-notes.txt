According to geohot there are four paradigms of programmig (on a high - level these are the languages that a normal programmar will
encounter):

1. Imperative: Imperative in english means something important. In programming, it is to follow steps to make the required 
changes to the state of the program. it follows each line of code serially. for instance: park a car. step 1, step 2 etc. 
Java and Python are considered imperative.

2. Hardware: these are languages that execute all the commands simulataneously. this is similar to the working of hardware. this includes
Coq and VHDL.

3. functional: these are languages in which the commands are functions itself. the commands are not serial and do not dictate
the state change. it essentailly define the fucntion and let the program work accordingly. eg: Haskell.

4. Machine Learning: this includes Lisp, Tensorflow, Pytorch. fundamentally these lang. are used for deep learning paradigm and
uses graph programming paradigm to do data processing and testing.

Q. what is the difference between library and framework?
A. Python eg. that can be used. sklearn is lib, while flask is a framework. essentially, both are used in API. lib. contains the function,
framework provides the skeleton of the application and API puts them both together. Both are also written by other dev. that we implement.
the key difference is that the code calls lib. while framework calls the code. this also defines Inversion of Control. (IoC). In lib. the 
flow of control is in the code as it calls the lib. in framework it calls the code when required. IoC is a concept in software eng. that
states to invert the flow of control.

A library is just a collection of class definitions. The reason behind is simply code reuse, i.e. get the code that has 
already been written by other developers. The classes and methods normally define specific operations in a domain specific area. 
For example, there are some libraries of mathematics which can let developer just call the function without redo the 
implementation of how an algorithm works.

In framework, all the control flow is already there, and there's a bunch of predefined white spots that you should
fill out with your code. A framework is normally more complex. It defines a skeleton where the application defines
its own features to fill out the skeleton. In this way, your code will be called by the framework when appropriately.
The benefit is that developers do not need to worry about if a design is good or not, but just about implementing domain specific functions.

Q. what is the difference between imperative vs declarative programming>
A. imperative program tells the compiler of how to achieve the desired results, step by step. for instance:
find odd numbers from list of 1 - 100. 
 if (num% 2 != 0):
  put it in odd list
 else
   null
 declarartive is subtle, as it tells the compiler of what the desired outcome should be but not how to achieve it. we see similar
 example in python porgram. (though python is imperative in design).
 control-flow is the execution of the indiviual statements or commands in step by step method, such as one found in imperative programs. control flow is a
 part of loop copnstructs.

Python is a programmaing language that was created by Guido von Rossum in 1990. It is imperative, interpreted, dynamic and
high-level language. If anyone is required to start programming, this be the language to be used. It is a good language for 
communicating with the machine.

Q. what is deep learning? how does it differ from machine learnin?
A.
