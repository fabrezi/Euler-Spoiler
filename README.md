# Euler-Spoiler
Solve Project Euler Questions in multiple languages.

>> The algorithm or the pseudocode is same for a specific problem. What changes is the syntax and programming format as a dev
   moves from one language to another. Though the project is to use only C to solve these problems, I find it a good way
   to test and see the workings in other languages.
